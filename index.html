    <div class="questions">
       I conducted a virtual usability test with my friend Griffin. Griffin is not a US resident and had little experience with Amazon. Here are the tasks I asked him to fulfill:
        <ol>
          <li>Create an account</li>
          <li> Search for men sneakers</li>
          <li>Compare prices for different brands</li>
          <li>Get the right size of your prefered sneakers </li>
          <li>Add item to cart</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="q1">

      <h2>1. Create an Amazon account</h2>
      <p> Creating an account seemed to be very easy for Griffin. He took about 2 mins to enter and confirm his details. He was able to do so fast and easily because of the well laid out log in page and very obvious details. Most of the deatails asked are the same details used in different applications. Previous experince with other apps and web applications made it easier to fulfill the task.      </p>

      <h2>2. Search for men sneakers</h2>
      <p> When I asked Griffin to search for the sneakers, he quickly went straight to the search bar on the top of the page and typed <strong><em>sneakers for men</em></strong>. The clear positioning of the tab at the top of the page made it easy for him to use the search bar to find the product he was looking for. After finding multiple results of sneakers, his attention was concentrated on the very first designs and brands that showed up on the screen immediately. He did not explore the various types of brands available.</p>

      <h2>3. Compare prices of different brands </h2>
      <p>Comparing prices took quite a while for Griffin. He scrolled down the page looking at different prices and mentally calculating the difference in their prices. This activity seemed quite frustrating and confusing for him because there were many options and it was hard to tell the difference between the quality of the brands in relation to its price. I realized that he did not utilize the filter search bar at the top right of the page. He also did not utilize the brand search bar to help him in the comparison. When I asked him later if he realized he could use the search tabs, he told me that he had not even seen them. He was able to fulfil the task though it took him about 5 mins.</p>

      <h2>4. Get the right size of your prefered sneakers</h2>
      <p>When searching for his right size of the sneakers, one challege Griffin had was converting UK sizes to US sizes. At first, he wanted to go to a different site and search for the conversion table. However, he soon realized that there was a conversion table beside the shoe size. I could see that he was frustrated by having to constantly convert sizes, but to his advantage, Amazon had a size chart in handy.He also did not like the organization of the sneakers because everytime he changed a small apect of the products eg. color, the layout oif the page changed. As he continued using the website, he became comfotable navigating it and he was able to use more helpful tabs. </p>

    <div class="q1">

      <h2>5. Add item to cart</h2>
<p> Adding the selected sneakers to cart was very easy for Griffin. It took him less than a minute. The <strong> <em>Add To Cart</em> </strong>tab was very visible and well positioned beside the item. This being the fifth activiry was also smooth for him since he had gotten used to the website. The outstanding color on the Add to Cart tab made it also very easy to trace the tab unlike other previous tabs.</p>
   </div>
    <div class="q1">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p> Overally, the website is well laid and relatively easy to navigate. However, most pages have too many information on the same place making it hard for users to identify and utilize all the properties. For instance, Griffin did not notice the <strong><em>sort by</em></strong> tab that would have been very useful in filtering his search for products. I think reducing the amount of information in the same position or maybe varying the font of different functionalities will help users utilize the website better.</p>
